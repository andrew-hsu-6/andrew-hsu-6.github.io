## About

Formerly an investment analyst working in finance. Now a student at Columbia University pursuing a career in software engineering. Feel free to connect with me as I begin my journey in a new field!

I'm interested in full-stack development and machine learning. Specifically, I hope to work on teams that are building products and features used directly by clients. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, tennis, and learning new things. My favorite soccer team is Chelsea, and my favorite tennis player is Carlos Alcaraz.
